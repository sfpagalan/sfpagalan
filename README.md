My name is Sydney, my pronouns are She/Her.
- Currently enrolled in a Software Developer program.
- Pretty new in the tech industry and would love to learn more!
- I love Anime! I have a big respect to Japanese culture. I can go on for days talking about how amazing the culture in Japan is and would go on non-stop to just talk about Animes.
- I also read a lot of books, Manga, Manhwa, and Manhua.
- I also play video games. Although, nowadays I just spend my time reading Manhwas or also called Webtoons. I still do play some mobile games like Mobile Legends.
- I'm also a PAWrent(Paw parent). I have a total of 7 cats - 3 of those are new litters and one Doggo!
